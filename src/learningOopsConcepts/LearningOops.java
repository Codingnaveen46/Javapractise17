        //object-oriented programming concepts
        //fundamental rules

        //classes => class is a template or prototype that we are going to store
                        // use to store all the data and methods objects together
        //object  => object is a oops concepts new instance of class is object
        //constructor => its a default method created by java when we are going to create a new class
                        // constructor method will be created with same name as class name;
                        //constuctor will help us to create object and throuh object we can access all the information

        //methods  =>   collection of statement / block of code   resuablity;

        //polymorphism => same method with different implementation
                          //compiletime(method overloding)
                            // Runtime (method overriding)

        //abstraction  => concept of hiding the implementation
        //can use before method //can use before class
        //we can't create object of the class
        //  extends abstract class must implement unimplemented methods of abstract class
            // otherwise child will become abstract


        //inheritance ==> inheritance is the concepts of extending the parent class properties into child class without creating object
                // multiple inheritance is not possible in java class1 extends class2 , class 3 which is not possible

                // multilevel inheritance is possible always class3 extends class2 class1 extends class 3


        //encapsulation => hiding the information
                            // private
                            // by creating public method  //getter // setter



        //interface => interface is 100% abstract class
                        //after java 8 we are using 2 more methods
                            // default method
                            // static method
                            //Implements used all unimplemented methods
